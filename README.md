# Modelling Carbon Dynamics responses to climate change in Boreal Forests of Eastern Canada
### Author: Dr. Yosune Miquelajauregui Graf

### About this model
Diameter-size structured mdoel, coupled with a boreal soil C dynamics model and a fire effects model.
This hybrid approach is used to evaluate reponses of carbon stocks to climate change. Effects of climate on tree growth, decomposition rates and fire regime are incorporated.

The model uses as input inventory plot data, historical fire records (fire intensity and Drought Code estimates), projected weather variables generated by BioSim as well as projected fire maps. It operates at 1-ha forest patches and runs at annual time steps. At the end of simulation run it calculates C stoks and fluxes.

### Data acquisition

The inventory plot data belongs to the Québec Ministry (Ministère des Forêts, de la Faune et des Parcs), and it is not transferable. Data was made available for research purposes through the Université Laval library (http://geoindex-plus.bibl.ulaval.ca/), under the agreement held between the government and the university. Inventory plot data is available on request by contacting the forest inventory division of the ministry (http://www.mffp.gouv.qc.ca/forets/inventaire/). All interested researchers can access the data in the same way the authors did. The authors confirm that the historical fire data underlying the findings can be obtained from Figshare: http://figshare.com/account/projects/5641. 
The data shared here contains preprocessed and strcutured information that serves as model input.
