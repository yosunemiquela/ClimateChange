#About this model
Diameter-size structured mdoel, coupled with a boreal soil C dynamics model and a fire effects model.
This hybrid approach is used to evaluate reponses of carbon stocks to climate change. Effects of climate on tree growth, decomposition rates and fire regime are incorporated.

The model uses as input inventory plot data, historical fire records (fire intensity and Drought Code estimates), projected weather variables generated by BioSim as well as projected fire maps. It operates at 1-ha forest patches and runs at annual time steps. At the end of simulation run it calculates C stoks and fluxes.
